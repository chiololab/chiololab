Welcome to the Chiolo Lab GitHub Repo! The Chiolo Lab at the University of Southern California uses Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to study
DNA double strand break (DSB) responses in pericentromeric heterochromatin. DSBs in this region are prone to abberant recombination due to the 
highly repetitive nature of heterochromatic sequences. In 2011, Dr. Irene Chiolo discovered that DSBs in heterochromatin relocalize to the nuclear periphery to 
facilitate homologous recombination. This repo contains scripts used for the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data to elucidate the mechanisms 
of DSB repair in pericentromeric heterochromatin.
